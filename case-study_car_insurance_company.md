Dear XXX,

Welcome to our company “Car Safe”. It is a pleasure to have you on board.
We are a car insurance company and we want to transition to a data-driven company. Recently, we are experiencing a large number of claims that are jeopardizing the viability of the company.  As Data Analyst we would like you to go deeper into this problem and answer some business questions:

- Sales channel analysis:
    - Which each sales channel has more claims? 
    - Within each sales channel which kind of car is sending more claims?
    - What is the car size which has more claims?
- User analysis: What is the user profile of the biggest claimant?
    - Are there any differences by gender and marital status?
    - What are the educational level and employment statuses of our biggest claimants?
    - Where does the biggest claimant live?
    - Which policy type and coverage has the most claims?
- Time evolution:
    - Which day of the week shows the most claims?
    - Are we charging our customers accordingly?
        - How much are our customers paying monthly since they submitted their last claim?
        - Are there any differences by vehicle class and size?

Please prepare a Tableau story that contains self-explained plots to answer the above questions. Our CEO would like to have answers in our next meeting. Also, it will be nice to have business actions to take.

Best regards,

Leesa Monroe. Car Safe CTO
