# Lab | Tableau Sheets 1

During this lab and the next five, you're going to work with a different business case than the ones used during the lessons. You will take the role of a Data Analyst newly hired by a car insurance company. Please read carefully the following [case study-car insurance company](case-study_car_insurance_company.md) to introduce yourself to the business case.

1. Horizontal bar plot with the **number of Claims by Sales Channel**. Add labels to show the number of claims in each bar.
2. Horizontal bar plot with the **number of Claims by Sales Channel and vehicle class**. Add labels to show the number of claims in each bar.
3. Horizontal bar plot with the **number of Claims by Vehicle Size**. Add labels to show the number of claims in each bar.
